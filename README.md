## Overview of Project

We are working with W. Avy on investing in a Surf n' Shake shop in Hawaii that sells surf boards and ice cream. His biggest concern is the weather, and specifically asked for weather data analysis in Oahu. In this particular analysis, W. Avy wants more information about temperature trends for the months of June and December.  This will help him determin if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable all year.  


## Results

- The average temperature in June is 74.9 degrees, and the average temperatue in December is 71.0 degrees. 
- The lowest temperatue in June was 64 degrees, and the lowest temperatue in December was 56 degrees. 
- In June, 75% of the days had a temperature greater than 73 degrees, and in December, 75% of the days had a temperature greater than 69 degrees.

## Summary

Overall, I think Oahu would be a perfect location for this Surf n' Shake shop due to the year round warm temperatures.  Whether it is in June or December, majority of the days are greater than 69 degrees and suitable for surfing and eating ice cream.  I also ran queries on precipitation in April and October.  The most it rained 75% of the days was 0.1 inches in April and 0.09 inches in October.  See below:
